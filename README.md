# Body Track VR – EMG Biofeedback in Virtual Reality

**Body Track VR** is an academic project developed to visualize electromyographic (EMG) activity in real-time through a virtual reality (VR) environment. It offers users interactive biofeedback using a customizable 3D human avatar and is designed for rehabilitation, education, and clinical applications. This project is mainful designed for use in personalizes treatments to optimize the results of rehabilitation therapies.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Real-time biofeedback using EMG signals
- Custom avatar selection for better personalization
- Muscle group selection and highlighting
- Interactive VR visualization of muscle activity
- Simple and intuitive calibration interface

## 🧠 Features

- ✅ Muscle selection via toggles in UI
- ✅ Avatar choice (man, woman, boy, girl)
- ✅ MVC-based EMG calibration panel
- ✅ Real-time muscle coloring based on EMG data
- ✅ Avatar rotation and zoom for better visualization

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Unity 3D** (2022.x)
- **TCP/IP Protocol**
- **MATLAB Scripts**  
- **C#** – Custom scripting   
- **NORAXON Ultium EMG system**  
- **Meta Quest-compatible VR SDK**

## 📚 Academic Context

This is the Final Degree Project (TFG) of **Esther Bermejo**, developed during the Biomedical Engineering degree at the **University of Alicante** (2021–2025).
🏅 Grade: 9.5 / 10
